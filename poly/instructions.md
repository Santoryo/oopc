# Polynomial

Write the class representing a polynomial, appropriate for the usage presented in this example.
Store in memory only coefficients which are not zeros (for example, in case of p = x^1000 + 6x^350 + 15 store only 3 coefficients, not 1001).
You are allowed to use containers from the C++ standard library.
Split the program into Poly.h, Poly.cpp and TestPoly.cpp files.
